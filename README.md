# File-Reader

Read in conjunction with DebugsAndAims.txt

A program that I started a while ago go become familiar with file manipulation in python and creating basic interfaces.

Currently, the program can:

-open and edit csv and txt files, able to add columns and rows to the csv
-find means in a column of numbers
-graph two columns of numbers (points or lines)
-Load a file located in the same directory as the program, hence the example files - Planning to implement the ability to edit any file
