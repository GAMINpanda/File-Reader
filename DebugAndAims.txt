Current Aim: Make a graph tool for 2D csv files (Only type in once I started work on graphing)
    -Done (ish)

    Make columns to graph selectable
    -Done

    Add just points to graphing, no line inbetween
    -Done

    Show the mean of a selected column

A sort of Debug log: (brackets means I went back after to put in method, based on memory and could be false)
    Problem: tkinter text boxes automatically create a new line at the end of the text box and I can't figure out how to get rid of it yet
    Solved

    Problem: global variables stay the same even if the displayed file changes
    Solved (declare global in function)

    Problem: add column is a bit glitchy
    Solved

    Problem: New values disappear after adding or removing a line
    Solved (needed to save before doing so)

    Problem: A list index is out of range when saving the 2d coordinate lists
    -Problem with the amount of spaces added when creating a new column
    -Only two spaces created

    Solved: python ranges don't include the last value

    Problem: Loading Broken
    Solved: had a value that should've been true as false (saying we didn't have the file type and name when we did)
